## Part 1: Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin ETFs
Today I learned that "buying Bitcoin" can mean two very different things effectively: buying the **Asset** or buying the **Wrapper**.

### The Core Difference
* **Spot Bitcoin (The Asset):** You own the actual digital keys on the blockchain. You can send it to a friend in Peru at 3 AM on a Sunday. You are responsible for security.
* **Bitcoin ETF (The Wrapper):** You own a share of a fund (like BlackRock's IBIT) that holds the Bitcoin for you. You cannot use it to buy coffee. It lives in your brokerage account alongside your Apple stock.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Spot Bitcoin (BTC) | Bitcoin ETF (IBIT/FBTC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trading Hours** | 24/7 (Never closes) | 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM (Mon-Fri) |
| **Custody** | Self-custody (Ledger) or Exchange | Institutional Custody (Coinbase Prime) |
| **Fees** | Network fees + Exchange spread | Expense Ratio (~0.25%) |
| **Tax (SG)** | Capital Gains generally tax-free | Capital Gains generally tax-free |
| **Best For** | True believers, utilizing as currency | Investors adding to retirement accounts |

**Verdict:** Since I am using Tiger Brokers for stocks, the ETF is more convenient. But to understand the tech, I need to eventually own the real asset.

## Part 2: The Forex Lab Setup
I decided to heed the advice: **Do not trade Forex with real money yet.**
I set up a "Paper Account" to simulate the market without the risk of ruin.

### The Setup on Tiger Brokers
1.  **Open App:** Went to the "Trade" tab.
2.  **Switch Mode:** Selected "Paper Account" (Simulation Mode).
3.  **Balance:** The system gave me **$100,000 USD** in virtual funds.

### My First "Trade"
I executed a test trade to understand the mechanics of leverage.
* **Pair:** EUR/USD
* **Action:** Buy (Long)
* **Size:** 0.1 Lot (Mini Lot)
* **Result:** Watching the P/L fluctuate in real-time.

### The Goal
For the next 3 weeks, my goal is NOT to double this money.
**My goal is to lose less than 2% of it.**
If I can survive 3 weeks without blowing up the account, I pass Phase 1.
